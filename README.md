# NPC Discord Bot

## Overview

This Discord bot allows you to manage and interact with characters in your server. It supports creating, editing, and deleting characters, as well as sending messages as those characters using webhooks. It also provides functionality for exporting and importing character data to and from a backup channel.

## Features

- **Create Characters**: Store character data including name, image URL, and background.
- **Edit Characters**: Modify existing character details.
- **Delete Characters**: Remove characters from the guild.
- **Allow Access**: Grant other users permission to use specific characters.
- **View Characters**: Retrieve and view character information.
- **Speak as Character**: Send messages as a character using webhooks.
- **Backup and Restore**: Export character data to a backup channel and load it from a JSON message.
- **Configure Asynchronous Marketplaces**: Allow your players to buy items from characters and use their loot! Avoid setting aside playtime to barter and sell.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Running the App Backend

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/f1nn3g4n/npc.git
   cd npc/
   ```

2. **Set the environment variables**:

   Copy the `.env_example` file.

   ```bash
   cp .env_example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file. It should work out-of-the-box as long as you provide a valid Discord app token, but it's a good idea to change the `ORACLE_PASSWORD`.

3. **Run Docker Compose**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   
   This will spin up the docker containers that runs the Discord bot and the Oracle database it uses to store its data.

## Viewing the log output

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f
   ```

This will show the logs for both the bot and the database.

If you wan to just see the logs from the bot, run:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f npc_bot_app
   ```

## Stopping the App Backend

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

## Installing the app to your server

1. **Create a Discord App**

   Create a Discord App in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   
2. **Get the app token**

   Get the app's token under Settings > Bot > Token. You can only see the token once when you generate it. If you lose it you have to make a new one. This needs to be put into your `.env` file of the backend.

3. **Find App Client ID**

   The `client_id` should be under OAuth2 > Client Information. It is the same as the Application ID under General Information.

4. **Enter the install link in your browser**

   Replace the `{client_id}` in the link below with your own and enter it into your browser. It should redirect to Discord and prompt you to choose a server to install it on and approve the permissions.

   `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&permissions=564034970057808&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands`

   The permissions asked for are set by the `permissions` integer in the link. You can see the permissions in the [Configuration section](#configuration).

## Configuration

### Discord Permissions

Below you can see the bot permissions that were enabled during development.

![Bot Permissions](images/bot_permissions.png)

### Backup Channel

The bot uses a specific text channel named `npc-character-backup` for backing up and restoring character data. If this channel doesn't exist, the bot will create it.

### Environment Variables

- **DISCORD_TOKEN**: Your Discord bot token. Make sure this is set in your environment.
- **Oracle DB information**: This bot is designed to use an Oracle Cloud DB. The Docker configuration uses [gvenzl/oracle-free](https://github.com/gvenzl/oci-oracle-free).

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot not responding**: Ensure your bot token is correct and that the bot has the necessary permissions in your server.
- **Commands not working**: Make sure your bot is properly synced with Discord's API and has the necessary permissions to execute commands.
- **Export/Import Issues**: Verify that the backup channel exists and that you have the correct permissions to send messages there.
